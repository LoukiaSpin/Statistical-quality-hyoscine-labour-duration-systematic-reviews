# Systematic reviews on labor augmentation do not align with recent advances in statistical methods: a case study on hyoscine butylbromide

## Description of the repository

The repository offers the typical structure of separate folders for data and R (code/scripts).
* The _data_ folder includes three .RData files: _data_syst_level_ with general and analysis-related characteristics, _data_meta_level_ for PICO- and analysis-related characteristics of the selected meta-analyses, and _data_meta_ for the outcome data of the trials included in the selected meta-analyses (this dataset was used in the re-analysis).
* The _R_ folder includes three analysis R scripts to replicate the Figures (main and supplementary): _Main Figures 2 & 3_ to replicate the main figures 2 & 3, _Supplementary Figures S1-S3_ to replicate the supplementary figures 1 to 3, and _MA re-analysis (Figure 4, Figures S4 & S5)_ to replicate the main figure 4 and supplementary figures 4 and 5.

After downloading/cloning the repo, the user can use the .Rproj file to source all code.
